Retry API compatible maintained project

This package had been developed on top of the original python [retry](https://github.com/invl/retry) package, and is intended to develop on top of it without implementing any breaking API changes and keeping the simplicity of the package.


### Roadmap
- [x] Type Hints and Annotations & Clean up code
- [x] Follow [Google Style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)
- [x] Async implementation for retry
